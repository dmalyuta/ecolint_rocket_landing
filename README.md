# Ecolint Rocket Landing

This repository contains the code used to generate the plots in my presentation
at Ecolint. You can run:

- `explore_initial_height.py`: analyzes the effect of landing burn start height
  on the fuel usage;
- `explore_control.py`: analyzes the effect of using feedback control on the
  soft touchdown accuracy when there is noise in the thrust generated by the
  rocket engine.
  
Some MATLAB and Simulink files are left over, but their are "useless".

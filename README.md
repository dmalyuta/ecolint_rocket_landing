# Ecolint Rocket Landing

This repository contains the code used to generate the plots in my
[presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pt-C16-qTEGr-wWMeIDPDRWSl-iWz_vhpcA7v-F84yg/edit#slide=id.g3bbe7cacff_0_0)
at Ecolint. You can run:

- `explore_initial_height.py`: analyzes the effect of landing burn start height
  on the fuel usage;
- `explore_control.py`: analyzes the effect of using feedback control on the
  soft touchdown accuracy when there is noise in the thrust generated by the
  rocket engine.
